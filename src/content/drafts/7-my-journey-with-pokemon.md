## Entering the World of Pokémon
Ever since I was in elementary school, I have loved Pokémon. I can't remember if I watched the show or played the games first, but I think that it is one of the best things my brother introduced me to as a kid. The franchise has evolved a lot over the past decade and a half and I have grown with it. 

My first memory of Pokémon was watching episode 19, *Tentacool and Tentacruel* at my aunt's house with my brother. I was around 8 or 9 years old, and found this episode through flipping through television channels. I did not watch much TV up to that point, so this show caught my attention. After that, I remember renting Pokémon episodes from our local library and watching them with my brother. Over many years, I think I watched almost every anime episode up to the fifth generation of Pokémon.

When I was 9 years old, I received my first Pokémon game: Pokémon HeartGold. My brother played its counterpart, Pokémon SoulSilver. Ever since playing that game, I was hooked. Today I will be reflecting on how the Pokémon video games have been a big part of my life ever since I was young. I will be talking about these games in the order I played them (not by Pokémon generation). For all of these games, you can assume my brother played its counterpart.
