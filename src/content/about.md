## Hey, I'm Leah!

Welcome to Calico Lemons, my personal blog. Here I'll document noteworthy adventures, experiences, or reflections I have throughout my time on this planet. 

My hometown is Philadelphia, PA, USA, but I am currently based in Nagoya, Japan working as a software engineer. 

In my spare time, I enjoy hanging out with friends, cooking, crocheting, and playing video games. I am always open to exploring new places, both local and far, especially if I get to eat delicious food.
