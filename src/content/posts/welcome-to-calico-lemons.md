## Hello

Welcome to Calico Lemons, a collection of paws (pauses - reflections), purrs (fun stories), and zesty surprises (adventures). 

Life is full of so many experience, both good and bad. For my own purposes, I have decided to create a personal blog to document various thoughts, reflections, and experiences to look back on later. Posts will range from my latest travels, to thoughts on the current game I'm playing, to my experiences learning new skills.

## Why Calico Lemons?

The hardest part of starting a blog (besides figuring out how to code it) was coming up with a name. Two things I have a great affinity towards are cats and food. Calicos are particularly close to my heart, as I own one back in America, along with a brown mackerel tabby. But Tabby Lemons doesn't really have the same ring to it as Calico Lemons, does it? I have a soft spot for the black, white, and orange mix, perhaps because my favorite color is orange.

<span class="caption text-muted">Some people say when life gives you lemons, make lemonade. But you can't make lemonade without water and sugar. So I say, when life gives you lemons, find a cat. Life is sweeter with a cat after all.</span>

As for lemons, I feel my life has a lemon motif to it. 'Leah' and 'lemon' start with the same two letters, lemonade is my favorite drink by far, I like lemon flavored candy, and my username for most sites include either 'cat' or 'lemon.' On my college graduation cap, I decorated it with the quote "When life gives you lemons, make lemonade." 

Thus through combining two things I love, the blog name was born. Thanks for checking out Calico Lemons, and happy reading!
