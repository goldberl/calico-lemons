## Preface

Ever since I was in elementary school, I have enjoyed watching anime and learning different languages. This inspired me to study the Japanese language and culture as an undergraduate in college. For my Japanese major, I wrote a thesis analyzing a genre of anime known as '*iyashikei*,' which loosely translates to 'healing.' I have picked out excerpts from my writing and provide a condensed version of my thesis in this post.

## Introduction

In my analysis of *iyashikei* anime, I want to explore how it provides an *iyashi* effect to an audience. I build on *iyashi* scholar Paul Roquet’s analysis of ambient literature, and argue that *iyashikei* anime acts as a tool of mood regulation. Through my analysis, I argue that ambient anime heals through plotless, non-narrative storytelling, that lets the viewer simply be present in a relaxed setting amongst “snapshots” of the characters’ various activities.

## Japan's history of 'iyashi'

The concept of *iyashi* most directly translates to “healing,” and it connotes physical and emotional comfort, which is achieved through a range of sensory experiences, particularly visual and tactile. Healing in this sense is emotional, not physical. In the context of this research, *iyashi* will be loosely defined as an experience that is calming and allows for rejuvenation and relaxation of the mind. Some scholars argue that the demand for “healing,” emerged in the 1990s as a result of Japan’s post bubble economy and two traumatic events in 1995: (1) the Kobe earthquake and (2) the Aum Shinrikyo sarin gas attacks. Others note that the neoliberal restructuring of the Japanese workforce contributed to the rise in mental health issues, particularly depression and anxiety, which added to the prevalence of *iyashi* culture in contemporary Japan.

The desire for healing generated demand for goods and services that promote relaxation and stress relief, such as music, art, books, a range of therapeutic modalities, television shows, and cafes. The most widely examined manifestation of *iyashi* in society has been cat cafes. 

## Scholarly views on 'iyashi'

Scholar Lorraine Plourde argues that cat cafes produce *iyashi* by creating relationships between cats and patrons through sensory experiences, and by providing a calm space to relax in. By interacting with the cats, whether by looking, playing, or petting them, patrons can feel at ease. Cats are *iyashi* objects to be desired and healing commodities that help ease loneliness and anxiety. For Plourde, *iyashi* is generated through in-person and immersive interspecies relationships.

#### Roquet's 'ambient literature' framework

In contrast, Scholar Paul Roquet looks at *iyashi* in literature as a tool for regulating one’s mood. He refers to this genre of literature as “ambient literature,” which promotes emotional healing and relaxation in multiple ways. 

The first is through “sensory invocation,” extended descriptions of the “soothingness” of objects through their sound, texture, color, and light. The second way is by establishing “incubatory spaces,” physical locations that remove one from the outside world and evoke safety and comfort. These spaces generally feature activities outside the chaos of busy modern life. Third is “ambient subjectivity,” described as a mundane repetition of everyday life activities that give a sense of expansive nondirectional time. Qualities of everyday life may include going to work or school, cooking, cleaning, or shopping for groceries. The last characteristic of Roquet’s framework is “narrative ambient counterpoints,” a subplot or component of the story that allows for a narrative of illness and healing. 

Roquet argues that these four components promote emotional healing, and frame ambient literature to regulate one’s mood in a calming manner. This scholarship similarly defines an *iyashi* experience through the commodification of comfort, a space separated from everyday life, elaborate sensory experiences, and mood regulating objects that can provide a sense of calm. 

## What defines an '*iyashikei*' anime?

I will focus on three particular anime series that are representative of the *iyashikei* genre: (1) *Laid Back Camp*, (2) *Flying Witch*, and (3) *Non Non Biyori*. These anime portray the genre’s unique trait of storytelling through “slices,” or what I will call “snapshots” of rejuvenating action in a straightforward manner. All three of these anime fall under the subgenre of slice of life, with *Flying Witch* containing minor supernatural elements. 

Their narratives can be stated in one sentence: *Laid Back Camp* follows a group of friends who enjoy camping in various picturesque sites around Japan; *Flying Witch* tells the adventures of Makato, a young witch, who leaves her home to study witchcraft in a peaceful, suburban neighborhood; and, *Non Non Biyori* is about Hotaru and her experience moving to a rural village from Tokyo, meeting new classmates, and gaining a fresh outlook on life. 

#### *Non Non Biyori*: walking through a tranquil forest

To see how characteristics of ambience are portrayed in *iyashikei* anime, first consider a scene (Figure 1) from the first episode (18:10 - 21:00) of *Non Non Biyori*. To welcome Hotaru to the rural area, the other characters lead her through a lush forest, where the other side is a clearing with a beautiful cherry blossom tree. The forest is illustrated with vibrant greens and natural browns. Sunlight filters gently through the leaves of the trees, casting a warm glow onto the ground. Small buzzes and chirps from the surrounding insects can be heard, along with the gentle footsteps of the characters on the forest floor. The cherry blossom tree in the clearing is illustrated with a range of soft pink hues and petals float gently around Hotaru as she approaches the tree. The sounds and sights of this scene envelop both the characters and the viewer in a sensory, nature filled environment.

<span class="caption text-muted">Figure 1: Walk through the forest and cherry blossom tree clearing.</span>

In this particular scene, the slow paced walk through the forest and the extended clips and angles of the cherry blossom tree establish the peaceful and calming atmosphere of the setting. Thus the countryside itself acts as an incubatory space and is portrayed as a safe and welcoming environment. The non-urban, nature filled setting of this anime provides the viewers with a break from a fast paced, urban lifestyle. Although the characters move around different spaces of the countryside, they revisit the same parts of the setting repeatedly. This repetition creates a feeling of comfort and familiarity with the setting as a whole. Throughout the show, the characters participate in a variety of activities. Some of these include attending school, taking walks in nature, and going out to eat. Despite the fact that none of these activities are particularly extraordinary, the characters consistently exhibit their excitement. These simple snapshots of life and cheerful character dynamics create an overall positive atmosphere for the show, as well as give it a sense of timelessness.

#### *Laid Back Camp*: enjoying hotpot on a camping trip

Another example of how characteristics of ambience are presented in *iyashikei* anime is in the third episode (9:31 - 11:45) of *Laid Back Camp*. The main characters, Rin and Nadeshiko, set up camp and enjoy a meal of freshly cooked hot pot (Figure 2). They are bundled up in puffy winter jackets, scarves, and hats. The campfire adds a white glow to the front of their faces amongst the starry night sky. There is an enormous amount of steam coming from the hotpot, and a small, satisfied smile on Rin’s face, along with a wide, excited smile from Nadeshiko. The bubbling and clinks of the stirring hotpot can be heard in the background amongst the calm voice of Rin, and cheery voice of Nadeshiko as they express their contentment with the food. Near the end of the scene, they remove their jackets, indicating that the meal has warmed them up.

The appearance of the characters, the colors of the cooking equipment, and how much the characters’ faces are lit up by the campfire are explicitly illustrated to viewers through the highly visual medium of anime. The vibrant animation allows the viewer to experience this scene with Rin and Nadeshiko through the many sights and sounds of the food and cooking equipment.

<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/post-img/thesis/fig2.png">
<span class="caption text-muted">Figure 2: Rin and Nadeshiko eating hotpot while camping.</span>

Furthermore, in *Laid Back Camp* the campsite acts as a safe space, offering both the physical warmth of the fire and emotional warmth of friends. It is porous in nature, as it hosts different characters and food dishes throughout the series. Additionally this space is transitory, as it is established and deconstructed every episode. The repetition of establishing these spaces invokes a sense of comfort and familiarity. These scenes all followed a similar sequence of events. 

First, the characters travel up to a campsite and survey the beauty of nature. Then, they set up camp, with the anime showing each step along the way. The camping gear is placed on the ground, tent posts are set up, the tent cover is thrown on, a sleeping bag is rolled out, cooking gear is set up beside the tent, and finally the characters sit down and let out a relaxed sigh. The orange glow and warmth of the campfire, along with the scenic view of nature, hot food, and the company of friends create an environment of safety and relaxation. Much like in *Non Non Biyori*, the events of *Laid Back Camp* are nothing extraordinary, being mainly limited to camping, cooking, and nature walks. This simplistic routine amidst a variety of scenic campsites create the anime’s relaxed atmosphere and, as with *Non Non Biyori*, provides a sense of timelessness. 

#### *Flying Witch*: cooking tempura in a quiet neighborhood

For the final example of these ambient characteristics in *iyashikei* anime, the magical world of *Flying Witch* can be explored. Much like the other two anime, *Flying Witch* takes place in a setting removed from an urban environment. The quiet, suburban neighborhood that Makoto moves to acts as an incubatory space, allowing the characters to roam freely and explore this safe environment. 

Additionally, similar to the other anime discussed, activities of the characters in *Flying Witch* are animated with vibrant colors, fitting sound effects, and descriptive dialogue, inviting the viewer to be part of a sensory experience with the characters. This is particularly exemplified in a scene (Figure 3) near the end of the second episode (16:52 - 19:50). Makoto and her cousin Kei are making tempura out of fuki (butterbur), an earthy and bitter sprout native to East Asia. The ingredients, illustrated in vibrant greens, and the sizzling oil of the tempura making process are integral to the sensory environment. When the characters taste their cooking, Makoto describes how salt complements the earthy taste of the fuki tempura, and how there is a bitter aftertaste which adds complexity to the dish. This descriptive dialogue immerses viewers into the experience and lets them imagine the taste for themselves.

<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/post-img/thesis/fig3.png">
<span class="caption text-muted">Figure 3: Cooking fuki tempura</span>

Consistent with the other anime, *Flying Witch* presents a simplistic, yet cheerful story. Although there may be some supernatural, magical elements in this series, they are not extravagant which allows them to blend in with the rest of the characters’ everyday activities. This magic is just enough to remove viewers from the reality of their own world, but subtle enough for the setting of *Flying Witch* to still present itself as peaceful.

#### Ambient Literature vs. *iyashikei* Anime

From these scenes, it is clear how traits of sensory invocation, incubatory spaces, and ambient subjectivity are presented in *iyashikei* anime. Sensory invocation is presented through animation and sound effects, incubatory spaces are created through peaceful settings, and the ordinary events and lack of conflict in these scenes are characteristics of ambient subjectivity. Despite the similarities between ambient literature and *iyashikei* anime, there is one key difference between the two: ambient literature and other genres of anime generally have a plot to their story. That is, they have a buildup of tension and then an eventual release at the end of the narrative. 

However, unlike ambient literature, it is not crucial to have narrative ambient counterpoints in *iyashikei* anime. In fact, most *iyashikei* anime contain little to no violence, surprises, plot twists, or conflict which results in a story that appears to lack a narrative. Thus I will attempt to comprehensively explain the unique narrative structure of *iyashikei* anime by giving several examples of how this genre lacks a narrative-driven story. 

#### *iyashikei* anime: a non-narrative driven story

In *iyashikei* anime, there are two ways that the story presents itself. The first is through an episodic structure. In these types of anime, each episode contains a singular story. Each episode contains the same main characters, but they do slightly different activities depending on the episode. These episodes can also be seen as standalone stories, as in the viewer could technically start with any of them and watch the series in any order. *Laid Back Camp* is structured like this. 

The other way that *iyashikei* anime stories present themselves is through several smaller, usually disconnected vignettes within one episode. This is like seeing three to five “snapshots” of the main characters’ lives in each episode. These snapshots are usually loosely connected, but they can also stand as their own story, and the viewer can watch each one without understanding the larger context. *Flying Witch* and *Non Non Biyori* are structured like this. 

#### 'Snapshots' of anime

The lack of a plot and the episodic structure of smaller stories that make up a larger series appear to be two characteristics unique to *iyashikei* anime. In other genres, the order in which episodes are watched matter, as each episode builds on the previous ones by expanding on the characters, settings, and conflicts. There is no big final resolution presented in *iyashikei* anime, and most, if not all of these anime can be summarized in one sentence that describes their entire premise. The details that happen in these anime are vignettes of this premise. 

I refer to these vignettes as “snapshot scenes.” The difference between the plot structure of *iyashikei* anime and other genres can be more clearly understood through Figure 4 below.

#### Snapshots of Anime

The chart on the left depicts the structure of an *iyashikei* anime, while the right illustrates the typical story flow of other genres. On the left, the basic premise represents the one sentence summary that can be provided which encapsulates the little background information needed to fully understand each story. The arrows pointing outwards towards the various “snapshot scenes” emphasize that each scene is self-contained and focuses on the present moment without building off other scenes. The only thing that these snapshots have in common is that they all happen in a similar setting with the same characters that are established from the premise of the show.

On the right, the typical flow of other genres is illustrated. Each part of the story builds on the last, with the presentation of a main conflict and resolution. To further understand the differences between the plot structure of *iyashikei* anime and other genres, I will consider two seemingly similar anime scenes, however, one is from an *iyashikei* anime and the other is from a non *iyashikei* anime. Through the analysis of these scenes, the unique plotless structure of *iyashikei* anime becomes more clear.

## The appeal of '*iyashikei*' anime

The appeal of *iyashikei* anime, of a seemingly pointless story, appears to lie in two main ideas: (1) the *iyashi* effect of these anime and (2) its relatability to a viewer’s real life. Furthermore, these snapshots appear to be pointless on their own, and hence create a feeling of the plotless nature of these anime. However they do ultimately accumulate into something grander and more meaningful. 

In *Non Non Biyori*, *Laid Back Camp*, and *Flying Witch*, the main characters develop new friendships and learn to appreciate the beauty of a quiet, nature filled setting. Just like in real life, friends are not made instantly. Rather they are made through shared experiences and conversations. These do not have to be eventful by any means, and most of the time, they are not. However it is the fact that these experiences happened at all that contributed to the greater reward of friendship.

#### The Point of Pointlessness

*iyashikei* anime romanticize the mundane, which may, but not always, allow viewers to gain a greater appreciation for the smaller, less noticeable aspects of life. Something as simple as eating a meal, going on a walk, or buying household appliances can be seen as exciting or pleasant through the lens of *iyashikei* anime. These stories take the background occurrences of one’s life and bring them to the forefront. They highlight the appreciation and charm that one may get from taking a few moments to pause and enjoy the experience in front of them, which I believe is ultimately the point of these seemingly pointless stories. 

In all, *iyashikei* stories are essentially the embodiment of the famous adage: 

<blockquote style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.3em; margin: 20px;">
  “It’s not about the destination, it’s about the journey."
</blockquote>


## Postface
Although I enjoy watching anime, I do not usually watch *iyashikei* anime. I prefer more narrative-driven, fantasy-adventure anime. As the concept of 'iyashi' is rather subjective, it is impossible to say that *iyashikei* anime will be 'healing' or enjoyed by everyone. However, I believe it is interesting to explore the purpose of such anime, and understand why this genre is appealing to many people in order to gain a better insight into Japanese history and society as a whole.
