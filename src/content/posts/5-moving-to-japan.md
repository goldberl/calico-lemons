## Introduction
What is the coolest thing you have ever done? I've done many cool things, but one of them was definitely moving across the world when I was 23 years old. I have always liked Japan, especially its pop culture (anime & manga) and studying the language. And as much as I loved my 4 month study abroad experience in Nagoya, I never imagined I would live there. 

The majority of my childhood was set in the suburbs of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and I was quite tired of living there. I did not have many friends, I did not like to drive, and I did not like the suburbs. So when I received a job offer as a software engineer based in Nagoya, I was really excited to try living abroad in a city that I knew I loved.

## The Invitation
February 7, 2024. On that day, I received one of the best emails in my life. I just got a job offer from a software engineer company located in Nagoya, Japan that I had interviewed with earlier that week. Just one month earlier, I had come back from my first time in Japan: a four month stay with a host family in Nagoya while I immersed myself in the language at an intensive language study program in Nanzan University. When I left my host family, I told them I would be back to visit Japan, but I didn't think it would be this soon.

I consider myself quite lucky that I seem to have landed the perfect job. After all, I double majored in Japanese and Computer Science in college, and this job was a software engineer job in Japan! When I came back to the states in January, I applied to one to two jobs a day, and those were mostly located in the United States. To be honest, as much as I loved my study abroad experience, I did not think I wanted to work in Japan. In school, I studied and heard about Japan's mentally harsh working conditions and I did not want to experience that. However, just for fun, I applied to a few companies in Japan under the condition that their job description pointed to an atypical Japanese work culture. And, here we are. I am young, I love Nagoya, and this seemed like a once in a lifetime experience. So of course I accepted the job offer.

#### Getting a Japanese Work Visa
The next steps of my journey included a lot of preparation, and with that came a lot of waiting. The process of getting a Japanese work visa included two main steps. (1) Applying for a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and then (2) bringing that COE to a Japanese Consulate and applying for a work visa there. The COE is not the easiest document to understand, but I had filled it out twice before when applying to study abroad (the first study abroad was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic 😔). So I filled out the COE form and sent it off the the company HR department to apply for my COE. They told me it could take anywhere between 1-3 months to get the COE, so all I could do at that point was wait.

Since I did not know when my COE arrived, and you have to make appointments with the Japanese consulate in advance, I had around 3 appointments lined up with them over the next two months. If my COE did not arrive by the time of the appointment, I would cancel it and book another one for a few weeks later. It seemed like an inefficient system, but I think it was the only way to ensure I would not have to wait another month to get an appointment once my COE arrived. 

Around 5 weeks after I sent the application to the HR department, my COE arrived on April 11, 2024. My parents and I took the trip up to the NYC Japan Consulate and applied for my visa. We also stopped to have lunch with one of my best friends from childhood, which was a nice bonus. A week later, my visa had arrived. 

#### Job Preparation & Apartment Hunting
During the 5 weeks it took my COE to arrive, I actually was pretty busy despite all of the "waiting around" I thought I would be doing. unfortunately, the rest of February and March was emotionally draining for me, as I had just gotten out of a pretty painful 1.5 year relationship. It was my first relationship and thus my first breakup which threw me into a whirlwind of uncomfortable emotions. As I was navigating those emotions, I knew I still needed to prepare for my move to Japan to set myself up for success. After all, I worked so hard to get here, I should start it off well.

The first thing I did was looked at was C++. The job listing posted that required skills included experience with that programming language, and I had none. So I followed along some YouTube tutorials and got a decent understanding of the basics. I was not sure exactly what kind of project I would be working on, so I was doing this to fill up time and keep my mind active.

I also had research to do in terms of plane tickets and apartments. The plane tickets were relatively simple. Although because I was arriving around Golden Week (a weeklong period of festivals in early May), plane tickets were pricy. Good thing the company was flying me out there.

Finding apartments was not so easy for a few reasons. (1) Japan is notorious for 
not renting apartments to foreigners. (2) The apartment listing sites with the most options were all in Japanese. (3) During Golden Week, most agencies are closed for apartment views which means that I would either have to wait to see apartments, or I would have to sign a contract before getting to Japan. Long story short, I had one of my Japanese friends check out an apartment before I got there. She approved. So I signed the contract.

#### Packing
Packing was both stressful and not too stressful at the same time. It was not that stressful because I had a list of things to pack. It was stressful because it was very difficult to pack everything in the suitcases I had. I own a lot of stuff, and that made it difficult to choose what to bring. In the end I brought mostly clothes, books, shoes, my pillow, and other comfort chachkas. I didn't bring many kitchen supplies and I left my winter stuff at home for my parents to bring to me when they visited.

#### Goodbye America
Once all the preparation was done, then I really time to wait. During this time, I also picked up crocheting and made some blankets before leaving America. I spent as much time as I could with family and my cats, as it would be a while before I would see them again, especially the cats. Leaving my hometown actually was not too difficult besides leaving my family and cats. I did not have too many friends or anything else tying me down anyways.

On the day of my flight, I said goodbye to my family, and snuggled my cats one last time before my ~20 hour travel (including layovers) to Nagoya.

## Flying to Japan
To fly to Nagoya, I first took a 1.5 hour flight to Boston from Newark. Then a 13 hour flight to Incheon (Korea) and finally a 2 hour flight to Nagoya. The time between my first and second flight was enough for me to get food. However the time between my second and third flight was stressful since I was not sure where to go and there was not too much spare time. I got to my gate just as the plane was boarding.

#### The Flight
To be honest, I don't remember the shorter flights much but I remember I watched a lot of movies on the 13 hour flight and received two meals. Since it was a Korean airline, the food was quite good. The best movie I watched on that flight was *Everything, Everywhere, All at Once.* I have been meaning to watch it for such a long time, but never got around to it until then. I was impressed, it was such a good movie. I also recently rewatched it here too. The movie is mainly in English but there are actually a good amount of scenes where the characters speak Mandarin. But since there were no English subtitles on Japanese Netflix and I don't speak Mandarin, I had no choice but to turn on the Japanese subtitles and make out the conversation through my eroding kanji reading skills.

Aside from the movies, I tried getting a bit of sleep. I am not sure if I was successful or not as I don't have the best luck sleeping anywhere but a bed. However I knew I should at least close my eyes and make an attempt to get some rest.

#### The Hotel
When I got to the Nagoya airport, my host family who I stayed with when I studied abroad kindly and graciously offered to pick me up from the airport and bring me to the hotel (that the company was paying for). I am so thankful for my host family for being the sweetest little Japanese couple who helped make my transition to Japan as smooth as possible. When I arrived at the hotel, it was barely big enough for me and my suitcases. But I didn't mind. It was pretty late so I just parked my suitcases to the side and went to bed.

#### My First Meal Back
I woke up the next day and decided to go get some food. Because I arrived to the hotel at night after a long day of travel, I did not have much trouble adjusting to the timezone. I remember the first meal I ever had in Japan when I landed to start my study abroad journey: a vending machine onigiri (rice ball) from the airport. Maybe you can't call that a meal, but that was the first thing I ate when I set foot in Japan for the first time. I guess my first real meal was some really good Japanese curry and rice that my host family made me. 

For my first meal back this time, I stopped by a nice udon place in Sakae (center city area of Nagoya). I love places like this in Japan because you technically do not have to talk to anyone to get your food. Instead, you buy a meal ticket at a vending machine for the food you want, and give it to someone behind the counter. They then prepare the food for you and serve you and you don't even have to say anything. I had niku udon (beef udon soup) and it was delicious. As I walked out, I thanked the staff for my meal, which they always appreciate, and went on with my day.
