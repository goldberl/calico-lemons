<p>Spending New Years abroad for the first time, I decided to do something new and spontaneous. I looked at my work calendar and realized I had 9 consecutive days off for the holidays and New Years, but no plans so I decided to make some for a solo trip somewhere. I never traveled by myself before so this seemed like an exciting new adventure. I didn&#39;t quite throw a dart on a map or anything, but going to Hakone was a bit spontaneous. Before doing some research, I never heard of Hakone before. I wanted to go somewhere with a good amount of nature and scenery. Hakone is known for its hot springs and views of Mount Fuji on a clear day. So, I planned a 4 day, 3 night trip of solo traveling and soul searching. I figured being on a solo trip on New Years would also be a good time to do a bit of self reflection as well. </p>
<h2 id="the-first-day---atami-castle">The First Day - Atami Castle</h2>
<p>I planned to take the shinkansen to Atami, and travel to a small town called Yugawara for my <em>ryokan</em> (traditional Japanese hotel). Atami, Yugawara, Hakone area are all in the same proximity so I can talk about all of them in a very similar manner. One thing I definitely did not realize about Atami was that it is covered with steep hills. On the first day, I arrived in Atami around noon and was pleasantly surprised how nice the station was. There was even an <em>ashiyu</em> (foot bath) at the station where people would take off their shoes and soak their feet in warm water sourced straight from a natural hot spring.</p>
<p>I ate a nice lunch in a nearby restaurant and then headed to Atami Castle. It was relatively close and I had some time before I could check into the hotel. During this trip, I had to rely on Japan&#39;s bus system to transport me to most places since the subway and train network did not cover the places I wanted to go. I took a bus to Atami Castle and was very surprised that it was on a very large and steep hill that I was at the bottom of. I didn&#39;t do any research before hand on the topography of Atami, but this was the first of many hills I would find here.</p>

<p><span class="caption text-muted">Atami Castle top floor | iPhone14</span></p>
<p>I brought my suitcase with me, which I had to lug up to the castle. Once I got to the top, there was a nice view of the surrounding nature. Atami Castle is probably my favorite castle that I have been to, and I have been to a lot. Perhaps I will release another post in the future ranking all the castles I have been to in Japan. Atami Castle had a really nice outdoor area surrounding it, with a small cafe and a beautiful view of the ocean. However, the inside of the castle was impressive as well. The castle has around 6 floors, including an arcade and play area in the basement.</p>
<p>I started from the top floor and made my way down. The top floor had a very nice view of the surrounding area and a footbath where you could relax and enjoy the scenery. The lower floors had several exhibits ranging from a Samurai Museum to Japanese word play games. As a non-native Japanese speaker, I was actually surprised with how many of these word games I could understand. For example:</p>

    <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/post-img/6-soul-searching-in-hakone/taiko.png" alt="Image" style="width: 500px; height: auto;">
</div>

<p><span class="caption text-muted">Taiko word play in Atami Castle | iPhone14</span></p>
<p>The hint for this picture is that the answer is an animal. This is a picture of a <em>ta-i-ko</em> (a Japanese drum). The middle of it is missing, so if you take out the middle character of <em>tai-i-ko</em>, you get <em>ta-ko</em>, which is Japanese for octopus, an animal.</p>
<p>There was also a floor that exhibited Japanese pornography in traditional Japanese painting style. I had never seen something like that in a traditional Japanese style before, so it was quite interesting to look at. After perusing the castle gift shop, I stopped down in the arcade to play a few games and charge my phone, as its battery was dangerously low. There is also a Trick Eye Museum (museum where you can take pictures with images that provide optical illusions) next to the castle, but I decided not to go in as I would just be taking lots of pictures of myself.</p>
<h2 id="everyday-is-leg-day">Everyday is Leg Day</h2>
<p>Making my way down the castle hill was much easier than going up it. I took a combination of trains and buses to my ryokan in the Yugawara area. According to Google Maps, the hotel was a 10 minute walk away from where the bus dropped me off. Well, to my surprise, this hotel was on another very steep hill and the 10 minute walk was uphill the whole way. The hill to the hotel actually made the castle hill look like an anthill. Looks like everyday, my legs will get quite the workout. I was a bit worried because my phone was hanging below 5% battery as I was making my way to the hotel, so I was just hoping it didn&#39;t die. Luckily, it died right as I reached the hotel doors.</p>
<p>I checked in and headed to my room. The hotel was quite charming and the amenities were nice. My room was actually a shared room, called a dormitory room. I had my own little bed cubby and shared the room with around 15 other people. Although I think only 4-5 beds were being used at a time. Once I settled down with all my stuff, I got some dinner (and hiked up that giant hill again), and then took a nice shower. Before going to bed, I soaked in the hotel onsen (public hot bath).</p>

<h2 id="the-second-day---manyou-park--atami-shoutengai">The Second Day - Manyou Park &amp; Atami Shoutengai</h2>
<p>I slept relatively well in my little cubby hole, and headed out for my first full day in Hakone. Before I arrived, I made an itinerary so I wouldn&#39;t be wondering what to do when I got here. However, I didn&#39;t quite calculate that a lot of things would be closed for the New Years holidays. I revised my plan on the fly and started my day in Manyou Park, a really nice nature walk near the hotel I was staying in. Once again, lots of hills. The weather was very pleasant and the park and its waterfalls were very nice.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="caption text-muted">Manyou Park | iPhone14</span></p>
<p>After exploring the park for a while, I headed back to Atami Station and explored the surrounding area. There were lots of restaurants and little shops to look at. Right next to the station, there was a <em>shoutengai</em> (outdoor shopping district/street) that I walked around for the rest of the afternoon. I don&#39;t remember buying too much but I really like window shopping. This day was also New Year&#39;s Eve so it was pretty busy everywhere. </p>
<p>There were not many food options near the hotel, so I bought some food from the convenience store to eat for dinner when I got back. I was so tired that night that after I took a shower, I went to bed. I did set an alarm to wake up before midnight to welcome 2025, but went back to sleep shortly after.</p>
<h2 id="the-third-day---mishima-skywalk--hakone-sightseeing-boat">The Third Day - Mishima Skywalk &amp; Hakone Sightseeing Boat</h2>
<p>I wanted to do something exciting on New Year&#39;s day, so I set off early to Mishima Skywalk, Japan&#39;s longest suspension bridge at 400 meters (~1312 feet) long. On clear days, you can see a really nice view of Mount Fuji from the bridge. I was able to see some of the mountain when I was there, but most of its top was blocked by clouds. Crossing the bridge took around 10 minutes, as foot traffic was slow. On the other side, there were food stands, small shops, and adventure activities. </p>

</div>

<p><span class="caption text-muted">Mishima Skywalk Mount Fuji View | iPhone14</span></p>
<p>I signed up for zipplinning, which was a lot of fun. There were two ziplines than spanned towards and back from where I first crossed the bridge. Unfortunately, Mount Fuji was still covered by clouds but zipplinning itself was exhilarating. </p>

</div>

<p><span class="caption text-muted">Zipline Gear | iPhone14</span></p>
<p>After my zipline adventure, I went to get some of the best ice cream I have had - a sorasoft (<em>sora</em> means &#39;sky&#39;, &#39;soft&#39; refers to soft ice cream). Sorasoft was made from butterfly pea, which gave it a pretty light blue color and a unique flavor.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="caption text-muted">Sorasoft at Mishima Skywalk | iPhone14</span></p>
<p>In the mid afternoon, I took a bus from the Mishama Skywalk to a Hakone boat tour adventure around Lake Ashi. I purchased a roundtrip ticket and had to transfer boats once during the one hour tour. It was nice to view the area from the boat and experience sightseeing from a pirate ship like designed vessel. It was a bit cold and windy, but I definitely think the experience was worth it.</p>

<h2 id="the-fourth-day---acao-forest--return-to-nagoya">The Fourth Day - Acao Forest &amp; Return to Nagoya</h2>
<p>On my last day, I checked out of my hotel and walked down that giant hill for the last time. Before returning to Nagoya, I planned to visit Acao Forest, a collection of gardens and outdoor art pieces that was around a 20 minute bus ride from the Atami train station. I first dropped my suitcase off at Atami Station, ate a yummy strawberry dorayaki (Japanese pancake confection with cream and strawberries) for breakfast, and then headed to Acao Forest.</p>

<p><span class="caption text-muted">Strawberry Dorayaki | iPhone14</span></p>
<p> When I got there, I enjoyed a sardine covered pizza for lunch where I was seated with a nice view of the water.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="caption text-muted">Sardine Pizza with an Ocean View | iPhone14</span></p>
<p>After I figured out how to enter the park (you had to wait for a bus to take you to the top of a hill, and then you would make your way down as you viewed each exhibit), I took my time exploring all the gardens. There is a &quot;sea side&quot; and &quot;forest side&quot; to the park. You start near the sea, where there are a lot of picture opportunities and then you make your way down to more flower gardens. In the sea side, there was a swing that you could sit on and view in ocean. </p>

<p><span class="caption text-muted">Acao Forest Sea Side View | iPhone14</span></p>
<p>Between the sea and forest area, I visited a nice cafe and had some tea and cheesecake as a snack. </p>

<p><span class="caption text-muted">Tea &amp; Cheesecake | iPhone14</span></p>
<p>Overall, Acao Forest offered a lot of scenic views and pretty flowers to look at, however I think that if I went when the weather was warmer, there would be many more flowers to look at.</p>

<p>Finally, I took a shinkansen back to Nagoya and ended my first solo travel adventure.</p>
<h2 id="trip-reflections">Trip Reflections</h2>
<p>I had a lot of fun planning and going on this trip. I felt like a real adult - I booked my own hotel, figured out all the travel, and paid for everything myself. It was quite a refreshing feeling. I was surprised by how hilly the Hakone/Atami areas were, but I really liked exploring all of the natural beauty it had to offer. My favorite parts of the trip were Atami Castle and Mishima Skywalk, although I really like mostly every part of it. </p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; border: 3px solid #000; width: fit-content; margin: 0 auto;">

</div>

<p><span class="caption text-muted">View on the way to ryokan | iPhone14</span></p>
<p>As someone who doesn&#39;t like talking to strangers, one skill I honed quite well on this trip was taking pictures of myself. To be fair, in Japan, a lot of picturesque locations have stands where people can set there phones to take certain photos. I would consider going back to Hakone sometime, just to see Mount Fuji on a clear day and have another sorasoft on Mishima Skywalk. Overall, I feel like I took full advantage of the time I spent in Hakone and I am happy with how the trip turned out.</p>
