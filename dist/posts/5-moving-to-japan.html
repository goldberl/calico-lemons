<p>What is the coolest thing you have ever done? I&#39;ve done many cool things, but one of them was definitely moving across the world when I was 23 years old. I have always liked Japan, especially its pop culture (anime &amp; manga) and studying the language. And as much as I loved my 4 month study abroad experience in Nagoya, I never imagined I would live there. </p>
<p>The majority of my childhood was set in the suburbs of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and I was quite tired of living there. I did not have many friends, I did not like to drive, and I did not like the suburbs. So when I received a job offer as a software engineer based in Nagoya, I was really excited to try living abroad in a city that I knew I loved.</p>
<h2 id="the-invitation">The Invitation</h2>
<p>February 7, 2024. On that day, I received one of the best emails in my life. I just got a job offer from a software engineer company located in Nagoya, Japan that I had interviewed with earlier that week. Just one month earlier, I had come back from my first time in Japan: a four month stay with a host family in Nagoya while I immersed myself in the language at an intensive language study program in Nanzan University. When I left my host family, I told them I would be back to visit Japan, but I didn&#39;t think it would be this soon.</p>
<p>I consider myself quite lucky that I seem to have landed the perfect job. After all, I double majored in Japanese and Computer Science in college, and this job was a software engineer job in Japan! When I came back to the states in January, I applied to one to two jobs a day, and those were mostly located in the United States. To be honest, as much as I loved my study abroad experience, I did not think I wanted to work in Japan. In school, I studied and heard about Japan&#39;s mentally harsh working conditions and I did not want to experience that. However, just for fun, I applied to a few companies in Japan under the condition that their job description pointed to an atypical Japanese work culture. And, here we are. I am young, I love Nagoya, and this seemed like a once in a lifetime experience. So of course I accepted the job offer.</p>
<h4 id="getting-a-japanese-work-visa">Getting a Japanese Work Visa</h4>
<p>The next steps of my journey included a lot of preparation, and with that came a lot of waiting. The process of getting a Japanese work visa included two main steps. (1) Applying for a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and then (2) bringing that COE to a Japanese Consulate and applying for a work visa there. The COE is not the easiest document to understand, but I had filled it out twice before when applying to study abroad (the first study abroad was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic 😔). So I filled out the COE form and sent it off the the company HR department to apply for my COE. They told me it could take anywhere between 1-3 months to get the COE, so all I could do at that point was wait.</p>
<p>Since I did not know when my COE arrived, and you have to make appointments with the Japanese consulate in advance, I had around 3 appointments lined up with them over the next two months. If my COE did not arrive by the time of the appointment, I would cancel it and book another one for a few weeks later. It seemed like an inefficient system, but I think it was the only way to ensure I would not have to wait another month to get an appointment once my COE arrived. </p>
<p>Around 5 weeks after I sent the application to the HR department, my COE arrived on April 11, 2024. My parents and I took the trip up to the NYC Japan Consulate and applied for my visa. We also stopped to have lunch with one of my best friends from childhood, which was a nice bonus. A week later, my visa had arrived. </p>
<h4 id="job-preparation--apartment-hunting">Job Preparation &amp; Apartment Hunting</h4>
<p>During the 5 weeks it took my COE to arrive, I actually was pretty busy despite all of the &quot;waiting around&quot; I thought I would be doing. Unfortunately, the rest of February and March was emotionally draining for me, as I had just gotten out of a pretty painful 1.5 year relationship. It was my first relationship and thus my first breakup which threw me into a whirlwind of uncomfortable emotions. As I was navigating those emotions, I knew I still needed to prepare for my move to Japan to set myself up for success. After all, I worked so hard to get here, I should start it off well.</p>
<p>The first thing I did was looked at was C++. The job listing posted that required skills included experience with that programming language, and I had none. So I followed along some YouTube tutorials and got a decent understanding of the basics. I was not sure exactly what kind of project I would be working on, so I was doing this to fill up time and keep my mind active.</p>
<p>I also had research to do in terms of plane tickets and apartments. The plane tickets were relatively simple. Although because I was arriving around Golden Week (a weeklong period of festivals in early May), plane tickets were pricy. Good thing the company was flying me out there.</p>
<p>Finding apartments was not so easy for a few reasons. (1) Japan is notorious for 
not renting apartments to foreigners. (2) The apartment listing sites with the most options were all in Japanese. (3) During Golden Week, most agencies are closed for apartment views which means that I would either have to wait to see apartments, or I would have to sign a contract before getting to Japan. Long story short, I had one of my Japanese friends check out an apartment before I got there. She approved. So I signed the contract.</p>
<h4 id="packing">Packing</h4>
<p>Packing was both stressful and not too stressful at the same time. It was not that stressful because I had a list of things to pack. It was stressful because it was very difficult to pack everything in the suitcases I had. I own a lot of stuff, and that made it difficult to choose what to bring. In the end I brought mostly clothes, books, shoes, my pillow, and other comfort chachkas. I didn&#39;t bring many kitchen supplies and I left my winter stuff at home for my parents to bring to me when they visited.</p>
<h4 id="goodbye-america">Goodbye America</h4>
<p>Once all the preparation was done, then I really time to wait. During this time, I also picked up crocheting and made some blankets before leaving America. I spent as much time as I could with family and my cats, as it would be a while before I would see them again, especially the cats. Leaving my hometown actually was not too difficult besides leaving my family and cats. I did not have too many friends or anything else tying me down anyways.</p>
<p>On the day of my flight, I said goodbye to my family, and snuggled my cats one last time before my ~20 hour travel (including layovers) to Nagoya.</p>
<h2 id="flying-to-japan">Flying to Japan</h2>
<p>To fly to Nagoya, I first took a 1.5 hour flight to Boston from Newark. Then a 13 hour flight to Incheon (Korea) and finally a 2 hour flight to Nagoya. The time between my first and second flight was enough for me to get food. However the time between my second and third flight was stressful since I was not sure where to go and there was not too much spare time. I got to my gate just as the plane was boarding.</p>
<h4 id="the-flight">The Flight</h4>
<p>To be honest, I don&#39;t remember the shorter flights much but I remember I watched a lot of movies on the 13 hour flight and received two meals. Since it was a Korean airline, the food was quite good. The best movie I watched on that flight was <em>Everything, Everywhere, All at Once.</em> I have been meaning to watch it for such a long time, but never got around to it until then. I was impressed, it was such a good movie. I also recently rewatched it here too. The movie is mainly in English but there are actually a good amount of scenes where the characters speak Mandarin. But since there were no English subtitles on Japanese Netflix and I don&#39;t speak Mandarin, I had no choice but to turn on the Japanese subtitles and make out the conversation through my eroding kanji reading skills.</p>
<p>Aside from the movies, I tried getting a bit of sleep. I am not sure if I was successful or not as I don&#39;t have the best luck sleeping anywhere but a bed. However I knew I should at least close my eyes and make an attempt to get some rest.</p>
<h4 id="the-hotel">The Hotel</h4>
<p>When I got to the Nagoya airport, my host family who I stayed with when I studied abroad kindly and graciously offered to pick me up from the airport and bring me to the hotel (that the company was paying for). I am so thankful for my host family for being the sweetest little Japanese couple who helped make my transition to Japan as smooth as possible. When I arrived at the hotel, it was barely big enough for me and my suitcases. But I didn&#39;t mind. It was pretty late so I just parked my suitcases to the side and went to bed.</p>
<h4 id="my-first-meal-back">My First Meal Back</h4>
<p>I woke up the next day and decided to go get some food. Because I arrived to the hotel at night after a long day of travel, I did not have much trouble adjusting to the timezone. I remember the first meal I ever had in Japan when I landed to start my study abroad journey: a vending machine onigiri (rice ball) from the airport. Maybe you can&#39;t call that a meal, but that was the first thing I ate when I set foot in Japan for the first time. I guess my first real meal was some really good Japanese curry and rice that my host family made me. </p>
<p>For my first meal back this time, I stopped by a nice udon place in Sakae (center city area of Nagoya). I love places like this in Japan because you technically do not have to talk to anyone to get your food. Instead, you buy a meal ticket at a vending machine for the food you want, and give it to someone behind the counter. They then prepare the food for you and serve you and you don&#39;t even have to say anything. I had niku udon (beef udon soup) and it was delicious. As I walked out, I thanked the staff for my meal, which they always appreciate, and went on with my day.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-life-in-japan">Building a Life in Japan</h2>
<p>Since I signed a lease before I came to Japan, I already had an apartment. Now I just needed to figure out how everything else worked, such as cell service, where to throw out trash/recycling, how to pay my bills, what was a convenient to walk to in my neighborhood, etc. Since I studied abroad in Japan before, I already knew how the subway system worked which made things a lot less stressful. If you ask anyone who knows me, they will tell you how directionally challenged I am, so if I can navigate the Nagoya subway lines, anyone can.</p>
<h4 id="cell-service">Cell Service</h4>
<p>Getting cell service was not a problem at all. I used <em>Mobal</em>, the same service I used when I studied abroad. I liked this service because they give you a Japanese phone number as well, which you need to open up a bank account and other memberships here. I paid a little more than $20 a month for 5 GB of high speed data. If those 5 GB ran out, I would still have data, but at a severely reduced rate. A few months later, I learned this was a really bad deal and was told to switch to <em>ahamo</em>, a Japanese service provider where I could get 30 GB a month for just under $20. After I figured out how to port out my number from <em>Mobal</em>, I made the switch. This entire process was actually quite simple, and I did it all online without having to talk with anyone.</p>
<h4 id="my-apartment">My Apartment</h4>
<p>Once I got the key to my apartment, I was excited to move in and make it my own. I remember walking into it for the first time and thinking that it was smaller than I thought, but I can make this work. There is a sleeping area, a kitchen, and a bathroom all in this 20 square (215 square feet) meter space. I chose a furnished apartment because I did not want to deal with the stress and expense of buying that kind of stuff when I got here. The apartment came with a bed, TV stand, TV, microwave, fridge, small table, and washing machine. </p>
<h4 id="trip-to-ikea--nitori">Trip to Ikea &amp; Nitori</h4>
<p>Even though the apartment came furnished, I still needed to get a few things from Ikea to make it even more homey. My sweet host family offered to drive me there and move everything I buy into my apartment. We woke up early one morning and off we went. Ikea in Japan isn&#39;t too different to Ikea in America, in fact, they are quite similar. Only difference was Americans pronounce Ikea as <em>eye-key-yah</em> while the Japanese pronounce it <em>ee-kay-yah</em>. </p>
<p>I had a lot of fun walking through the whole store and checking things out. Some things I bought included a few lamps, a really nice coatrack, a bedside table, and a rolling cart for my kitchen. We came back from Ikea and my host family helped me build and set everything up in my apartment. I remember they put together the funky looking coat rack I got, which I am appreciative of because it looked kind of complicated to put together. Afterwards, I had my first meal in the apartment with them: Costco sushi. It was a lovely day.</p>
<p>The rest of my essentials, such as pots, pans, bedding, etc., I bought from Nitori. My host family was kind enough to help me with that as well. And they gave me some old dishes and drinking glasses that they were not using so I didn&#39;t have to buy any. I am very grateful for that.</p>
<h4 id="figuring-out-japanese-bedding">Figuring Out Japanese Bedding</h4>
<p>Surprisingly, one of the most difficult things for me to do was figure out Japanese bedding. The bed my apartment came with was a typical bed frame and not a futon, so I thought I knew what to look for. In America, my bed has a fitted sheet, top sheet, and a blanket. Those were the three items that I was looking for in Nitori as well. Specifically, a fitted sheet &amp; top sheet set (like they sell in America), and then a blanket. Well, I quickly learned that, futons aside, Japanese beds were a bit different than what I was used to.</p>
<p>In Japan, bedframe beds have the following three parts: fitted sheet, duvet, and duvet cover. There is no top sheet. And as I was looking at the Japanese terms, I got even more confused.These were the terms I saw floating around Nitori:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Shikibuton</em> (敷布団): Traditional Japanese bottom futon mattress that is put directly on the floor.</li>
<li><em>Kakebuton</em> (掛け布団): Duvet that is used like a blanket for the futon.</li>
<li><em>Shikibutonkaba (cover)</em> (敷布団カバー): Cover for a <em>shikibuton</em>.</li>
<li><em>Kakebutonkaba (cover)</em> (掛け布団カバー): Cover for a <em>kakebuton</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I thought that a futon was just something you sleep on and did not realize a <em>kakebuton</em> was a duvet. Also, I could not tell if a  <em>shikibutonkaba</em> and a fitted sheet were the same thing. Turns out they are different. A <em>shikibutonkaba</em> goes around the whole bottom futon, while a fitted sheet just hugs the top of the mattress. I soon figured out that fitted sheets was <em>supporishi-tsu</em> (シーツ) in Japanese. Once I got that all down, I was finally able to buy my bedding.</p>
<h4 id="seria-saves-my-wallet">Seria Saves My Wallet</h4>
<p>One of the best things about Japan are its dollar stores. They are cheap, convenient, and the quality of the items is actually very good for the price. The one I went to the most was Seria, as there was one located in my local neighborhood mall. These dollar stores sell all kinds of things from dishes, to kitchen/bath utilities, to yarn and other crafty items. I mostly got smaller things here such as my kitchen tools (tongs, ladle, etc) and cleaning supplies. Seria also has an assortment of attractive items that I buy (even if I don&#39;t really need them) such as picture frames, magnets, jars, and bags. And the best thing is, everything is only 100 yen (less than 75 cents USD)!</p>
<h2 id="first-day-of-work">First Day of Work</h2>
<p>I woke up on May 13, 2024 for my first day of work. Of course I was nervous, and I didn&#39;t know what to expect. I did scope out my office a few days before to make sure I could get there on time. It took me around 40 minutes from my apartment to get there, which seems long but considering the average home to work commute time in Japan in an hour, it was not too bad. I was told to be in the office at 9:30 AM. I woke up early that day so I hung around in my apartment in the morning before hopping on a train around 8:30 AM.</p>
<p>I got to the office door and opened it. Everyone looked up and I saw one person I recognized: the manager who interviewed me. He smiled and stood up to shake my hand and welcome me into the office. I was then given a desk and a computer. I set up the computer and another coworker helped me set up the project that I was going to work on. Over the next few days, I met more of my coworkers and went out to lunch with them. Overall, I am thankful everyone was quite kind and willing to help me.</p>
<h4 id="navigating-company-culture">Navigating Company Culture</h4>
<p>The company I work for is unique in a lot of ways I think. It is a Japanese company located in Nagoya and its employees are from all around the world. Unlike traditional Japanese companies, we don&#39;t have pressure to work overtime or go to nomikais (after work drinking parties). A lot of employees are under the age of 50 years old, and I was the youngest in the company when I joined at 23 years old. Two weeks later, a 22 year old joined so that title was short lived. </p>
<p>Anyways, it took a bit of time to get used to working a desk job. The last time I sat at a desk for eight hours a day straight was when I was high school. I eventually found my rhythm though and thanks to my coworkers, found some good restaurants to go to for lunch.</p>
<p>As in most STEM jobs, the majority of the workforce was male and this company was no exception. It definitely felt a little strange being one of the youngest and a woman who was given a good amount of responsibility from the start. Major imposter syndrome. But I am happy to say that mostly everyone was respectful and kind to me despite my inexperience. I definitely learned a lot in the first six months on the job, both technically, and about work culture and myself as a person.</p>
<h4 id="first-job-impressions">First Job Impressions</h4>
<p>I am really happy so far with the job. I did not have any expectations coming in, so I think that my open mind helped me adapt to the environment quickly. The first project I worked on was a bit overwhelming but built up my confidence that I can learn quickly on the job. The second project I worked on was really fun, thanks to what I learned on the first project. I am looking forward to learning a lot more moving forward.</p>
