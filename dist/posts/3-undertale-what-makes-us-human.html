<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>Undertale is a role-playing video game created by indie developer Toby Fox. The player controls a child who has fallen into the Underground: a large, secluded region under the surface of the Earth, separated by a magic barrier. The player meets various monsters during the journey back to the surface (Wikipedia).</p>

<p><span class="caption text-muted">Undertale Title Screen</span></p>
<p>There are three main ways players can play the game:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(True) Pacifist route</strong>: Players spare all monsters.</li>
<li><strong>Neutral route</strong>: Players spare some monsters, and kill others.</li>
<li><strong>Genocide route</strong>: Players kill all monsters.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="undertale--humanity">Undertale &amp; Humanity</h2>
<p>Undertale is a game that has great characters, emotional soundtracks, and an intriguing story. One deeper concept that Undertale explores but doesn&#39;t state directly is the definition of humanity. In other words, what makes the us human? </p>
<p>We are given some information about human souls and determination in the True Pacifist Route, but there&#39;s something else that is even more interesting when it comes to defining humanity: the Genocide Route.</p>
<h2 id="pacifist-route---defining-determination-in-the-true-lab">Pacifist Route - Defining Determination in the True Lab</h2>
<p>But first, let&#39;s look at the information given to us in the True Pacifist Route. The player is told that one human soul is stronger than all the souls of the monsters in the Underground put together. Consequently, humans can possess DETERMINATION, while monsters can not. The monsters&#39; bodies are not strong enough to possess determination, for if they try to, their bodies melt. The most obvious examples of this are in the True Lab. The amalgamates have all melted together because their bodies could not hold the injected determination. So now that asks the question, what exactly is determination?</p>
<p>Entry #5 in the True Lab reads, &quot;The will to keep living... The resolve to change fate. Let&#39;s call this power... &#39;Determination.&#39;&quot; Additionally, in the Genocide Route, after Undyne  gets hit protecting Monster Kid, she says, &quot;Deep, deep in my soul, there&#39;s a burning feeling I can&#39;t describe. A burning feeling that WON&#39;T let me die.&quot; </p>
<p>Overall, the game defines &#39;determination&#39; as &#39;a will to live&#39; and &#39;the resolve to change fate.&#39; Similar to that, &#39;determination&#39; can be defined as &#39;the willpower not to give up&#39; or &#39;the ambition to achieve something.&#39; Now we wonder, do you need a strong soul to have determination? Or does your soul become strong if you have determination? Perhaps it is a mix of both.</p>

<p><span class="caption text-muted">Determination in Undertale</span></p>
<p>It may be hard to believe that the monsters in the Underground don&#39;t have &#39;a will to live.&#39; The only one who truly shows &#39;determination&#39; is Undyne. But since her soul was not strong enough, her body could not take it. However, the rest of the monsters did not particularly show a &#39;will to live.&#39; Specifically Sans. He&#39;s apathetic because he knows the truth about the player&#39;s actions. Best case scenario, the player doesn&#39;t reset the True Pacifist ending, but the game doesn&#39;t continue after that. Therefore, the player is likely to reset the timeline, causing all the monsters to end up in the Underground once again. Perhaps all the monsters feel this kind of apathy because they do not have hope for ever reaching the surface, so they just accept their death if it comes.</p>
<p>Flowey is a bit of a special case because he is PURE determination. He doesn&#39;t exactly have a soul and determination was injected into him. It can be argued that Flowey has Asriel&#39;s soul, but even if he does, Asriel&#39;s soul is scattered into dust throughout Flowey, so I&#39;m not sure that counts as a soul. Looking at Flowey&#39;s nature is a good transition to talking about the Genocide Route. Flowey is a murderous, uncompassionate being that feels no emotion. That&#39;s also exactly how we could describe the player during the Genocide Route.</p>
<h2 id="genocide-route---monsters-see-you-as-just-another-monster">Genocide Route - Monsters See You as Just Another Monster</h2>
<p>Throughout the Genocide Route, there are many instances where monsters do not treat you as human, instead they treat you as just another monster. In other words, the Genocide Route strips the player of their compassion, and overall their humanity. I think the main thing we can take away from this is that part of being a human is being compassionate and being able to feel emotions. Most monsters (except Toriel and Alphys) try to kill you at some point... so yeah they don&#39;t have much compassion either.</p>
<p> Let&#39;s list all the instances in the Genocide Route where the monsters denounce the player&#39;s humanity.</p>
<p><strong>Toriel</strong> - You betrayed Toriel and she takes note of that before dying. She saw you as human, but after killing all those monsters in the RUINS, she states:</p>
<blockquote style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.3em; margin: 20px;">
  "Now I see who I was protecting by keeping you here. Not you...but them!"
</blockquote>

</div>

<p><span class="caption text-muted">Toriel while killing her in the genocide route</span></p>
<p><strong>Flowey</strong> - After killing Toriel, Flowey says: </p>
<blockquote style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.3em; margin: 20px;">
  "You're not really human, are you? No. You're empty inside. Just like me."
</blockquote>


<p><strong>Sans</strong> - When you meet him he says:</p>
<blockquote style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.3em; margin: 20px; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive, sans-serif;">
  "my brother'd really like to see a human... so, y'know, it'd really help me out... if you kept pretending to be one"
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Papyrus</strong> - When Papyrus first sees you (because you didn&#39;t hide behind the conveniently shaped lamp), he asks Sans if he&#39;s seen a human yet. Sans says yeah, and Papyrus says &quot;Great!&quot; then walks away without taking note of you. Papyrus  does not recognize you as a human. Then when you see him again, (when Sans pulls the rock joke first), Papyrus says while looking at the player, </p>
<blockquote style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.3em; margin: 20px;">
  "What am I looking at? I have no idea what that is."
</blockquote>

<p>Only when Sans says that the player is not a rock, Papyrus concludes that &quot;by process of elimination, that means it&#39;s a human!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Undyne</strong> - Before she turns into Undyne the Undying, she remarks: </p>
<blockquote style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.3em; margin: 20px;">
 "Human. No, WHATEVER you are. For the sake of the whole world, I, UNDYNE, will strike you down!"
</blockquote>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; border: 3px solid #000; width: fit-content; margin: 0 auto;">
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/post-img/3-undertale-what-makes-us-human/undyne.png" alt="Image">
</div>

<p><span class="caption text-muted">Undyne in the genocide route</span></p>
<p><strong>Muffet</strong> - Technically Muffet does refer to you as a human... just not as a human worth eating. She says:</p>
<blockquote style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.3em; margin: 20px;">
 "What a shame. A human comes through and they aren't even fit to be eaten. Oh well! Rotten ingredients can always be discarded" 
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, you may look human, but your humanity is long gone.</p>
<p><strong>Mettaton NEO</strong> - In the Pacifist Route, when you make Alphys, she tells you that Mettaton has &#39;anti-human combat features&#39; and that he is &#39;an unstoppable killing machine with a thirst for human blood.&#39; During the Genocide Route when you &quot;battle&quot; against Mettaton NEO, no matter what you do, he doesn&#39;t attack you. That&#39;s because he doesn&#39;t see you as &#39;human&#39; so his &#39;anti-human combat features&#39; don&#39;t activate.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; border: 3px solid #000; width: fit-content; margin: 0 auto;">
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/post-img/3-undertale-what-makes-us-human/mettatonneo.png" alt="Image">
</div>

<p><span class="caption text-muted">Mettaton NEO does not attack the player in the genocide route</span></p>
<p><strong>Sans fight</strong> - Sans doesn&#39;t exactly mention the player&#39;s humanity here, but it&#39;s worth noting that his goal is not to kill you. Sans knows he can&#39;t kill you because you will always come back if you have enough determination. That is, determination in the real world. Sans&#39; real goal is to make you lose your determination and give up. He wants you to give up fighting him and reset the world so he can see his friends again. That&#39;s why his battle is so difficult. To discourage the player from trying to defeat him.</p>
<p><strong>Asgore</strong> - In the Neutral/Pacifist Routes, Asgore tells the player how he so badly wants to ask you if you want to have a cup of tea, but he can&#39;t since you are a human that he has to defeat you for your soul. In the Genocide Route, Asgore doesn&#39;t see you as human. He asks: </p>
<blockquote style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.3em; margin: 20px;">
"What kind of monster are you...? Sorry I can not tell. Why not settle this  over a nice cup of tea?" 
</blockquote>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; border: 3px solid #000; width: fit-content; margin: 0 auto;">
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/post-img/3-undertale-what-makes-us-human/asgore.png" alt="Image">
</div>

<p><span class="caption text-muted">Asgore in the genocide route</span></p>
<p>Yeah after killing Sans, you are a real monster.</p>
<p><strong>Chara</strong> - If you do Genocide more than once, Chara tells they player that they no longer understand them. At this point, the player is worse than Chara, and Chara advises that if the player recreates the world again, they should choose another path.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In all, there are three main ideas that defines humanity in Undertale: </p>
<ol>
<li>The will to keep living. </li>
<li>The resolve to change fate, or a purpose. </li>
<li>Compassion for other beings/the ability to have emotions</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="caption text-muted">Save points fill the player with determination</span></p>
<p>The player arguably has none of of these during the Genocide Route. I would say humans should have the 1st and 3rd idea... the 2nd one is a bit difficult to figure out sometimes. These are the things that differentiate humans from monsters.</p>
