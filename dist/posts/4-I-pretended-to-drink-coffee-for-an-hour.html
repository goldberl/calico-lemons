<p>Back in my sophomore year of college, I was asked to help two of my East Asian Studies (EAS) professors with a research project. I collected data from various EAS editorial boards for my professors to analyze in order to study the representation of editors from liberal arts colleges in these journals. The study resulted in a short article, titled <a href="https://criticalasianstudies.org/commentary/2022/5/30/notes-from-the-field-neil-j-diamant-amp-shawn-bender-where-are-all-the-college-faculty-editorial-inequity-in-east-asian-studies-journals" target="_blank">Where Are All the College Faculty? Editorial Inequity in East Asian Studies Journals</a>, that was published in the <a href="https://criticalasianstudies.org/" target="_blank">Critical Asian Studies</a> online journal. </p>
<p>In short, the conclusion of the study was that liberal arts colleges do not have as much representation on EAS editorial boards compared to larger universities. This may lead to the ideas generated in smaller academic settings not being equally included or represented in the overall discourse of East Asian academia.</p>
<p>To thank me for collecting the data used in this study, my professors invited me to &quot;chat over coffee.&quot; Not too long before this, another college staff member also invited me to &quot;chat over coffee.&quot; I do not like coffee, at all. So, I responded with &quot;I don&#39;t drink coffee, but hot chocolate would be nice.&quot; Then I was told that response was unnecessary and that &quot;chatting over coffee&quot; is just a code for getting together, and coffee was not necessarily included. So when my EAS professors invited me, I agreed without saying anything extra.</p>
<h2 id="the-chat">The Chat</h2>
<p>One afternoon, I met my professors in a nice courtyard behind the EAS buildings on campus. We greeted each other and they handed me a cup of coffee from the local college town coffee shop. Well, maybe this time I should have specified that I did not like coffee. Too late. We sat down and started chatting. I think this was one of the first times where I talked to my professors so casually about anything and everything. It was not related to the paper they wrote or even EAS related. I did not talk too much but, I remember being impressed with the intellectual conversation going on.</p>
<p>So throughout this chat, I was holding my coffee. I took one sip at the beginning to confirm whether or not my tastebuds agreed with the flavor. They did not. I did not want to seem rude, so every now and then, I would put my lips to the lid and pretend to take a sip. I tilted the cup just enough for the hot liquid to touch my lips, but I kept my lips closed. At some point, I started wondering when enough was enough. I didn&#39;t want to keep pretending to drink the coffee for too long, or else it would seem like I had infinite coffee in the cup. After around an hour, the chat ended and I thanked them for their time. Then I poured the coffee out in a nearby trashcan. I am sorry for the $4 lost on this coffee. Besides the coffee, I did enjoy the chat overall.</p>
<h2 id="where-is-the-line---networking--politeness">Where is the Line? - Networking &amp; Politeness</h2>
<p>So, could I have avoided this awkward coffee situation? If I told my professors I don&#39;t drink coffee, I could have. But when should I have told them?</p>
<p>And where is the line between being polite and expressing your preferences in the front of your college professors or other higher-ups?</p>
